# INVERSE-OF-A-MATRIX
## Aim:
To write a python program to find the inverse of a matrix
## Equipment’s required:
1. 	Hardware – PCs
2. 	Anaconda – Python 3.7 Installation / Moodle-Code Runner
## Algorithm:
### Step1 : 
import numpy as np
### Step 2: 
consider a as a variable and np.array and give the values as the result
### Step 3: 
np.linalg.inv(a) by using this we got the result
### Step 4: 
print the result of the program
## Program:
```
#Program to find the inverse of a matrix.
#Developed by: 
#RegisterNumber:
import numpy as np
A=np.array([[1,0,3],[-1,2,-2],[2,3,-1]])
result=np.linalg.inv(A)
print(result)
```
## Output:
![output](inverse.png)
## Result:
Thus the inverse of given matrix is successfully solved using python program
